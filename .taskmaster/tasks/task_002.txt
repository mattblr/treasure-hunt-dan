# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Hero Section with Animated Background
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the hero section with event title, animated background, and GSAP parallax scrolling effects
# Details:
Build hero section using Tailwind's gradient utilities (bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900 to-black), implement animated background elements with GSAP, add parallax scrolling effect on scroll, include event title with custom typography using Google Fonts and Tailwind's font-family utilities. Add loading animation using GSAP timeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test smooth scrolling performance on mobile devices, verify animations don't cause lag, validate hero section displays correctly on different screen sizes within mobile range

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Hero Section HTML Structure and Tailwind Gradient Background [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base HTML structure for the hero section with semantic markup and apply Tailwind's gradient background utilities
### Details:
Create a full-viewport hero section container using Tailwind classes (min-h-screen, relative, overflow-hidden). Apply the gradient background using bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900 to-black. Structure the hero with a main container div, content wrapper for text elements, and placeholder divs for animated background elements. Ensure proper z-index layering for content to appear above animated elements.

## 2. Integrate Google Fonts and Create Event Title Typography [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add Google Fonts to the project and implement custom typography for the event title using Tailwind's font-family utilities
### Details:
Import chosen Google Fonts (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Montserrat) via link tag or @import. Configure custom font families in tailwind.config.js under theme.extend.fontFamily. Create the event title component with responsive text sizing using Tailwind's text-{size} classes, appropriate font weights, and text color that contrasts well with the gradient background. Add subtle text shadow for better readability.

## 3. Create Animated Background Elements with GSAP [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design and implement floating/moving background elements that will be animated using GSAP
### Details:
Create multiple SVG or div elements to serve as animated background shapes (circles, polygons, or abstract forms). Position them absolutely within the hero container at various starting points. Apply initial opacity, blur effects, and transforms using Tailwind utilities. Initialize GSAP and create animation timelines for each element with properties like x, y, rotation, scale, and opacity. Use repeat: -1 for infinite loops and implement varying durations and ease functions for organic movement.

## 4. Implement GSAP Parallax Scrolling Effect [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Add parallax scrolling functionality to hero elements using GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin
### Details:
Import and register GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin. Create scroll-triggered animations for different hero elements - have the title move slower than scroll speed (parallax effect), background elements move at different speeds for depth, and the gradient background potentially shift hue or intensity. Use ScrollTrigger.create() with appropriate start/end triggers and scrub property for smooth scroll-linked animation. Implement performance optimizations like will-change and transform3d.

## 5. Create GSAP Loading Animation Sequence [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop an engaging loading animation that plays when the hero section first appears using GSAP timeline
### Details:
Create a GSAP timeline that orchestrates the initial load sequence. Start with all elements hidden (opacity: 0, transform properties for entrance effects). Animate the gradient background first (fade in or sweep effect), then stagger in the background elements with elastic or back easing, followed by the event title with a typewriter effect or elegant fade/slide. Use timeline labels and position parameters for precise timing control. Add a loading overlay that fades out once animations complete.
