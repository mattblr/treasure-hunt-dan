# Task ID: 10
# Title: Final Testing and Mobile Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive testing across mobile devices and performance optimization for smooth experience
# Details:
Conduct thorough testing on various mobile devices and browsers. Optimize GSAP animations for performance, minimize JavaScript execution time, optimize image loading. Test touch interactions, gesture conflicts, and overall user experience flow. Validate all Tailwind classes are properly applied and custom CSS is minimal. Ensure 100vh viewport handling works correctly on all mobile browsers including Safari.

# Test Strategy:
Test on minimum 5 different mobile devices, validate performance metrics (load time, animation smoothness), verify all interactions work correctly, confirm no memory leaks or performance degradation over time

# Subtasks:
## 1. Mobile Device Testing Setup and Cross-Browser Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive testing environment for various mobile devices and browsers, focusing on viewport handling and browser-specific quirks
### Details:
Configure BrowserStack or similar service for testing across iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile, and Samsung Internet. Create a testing matrix covering different screen sizes (320px to 428px width). Implement viewport meta tag optimizations and test 100vh handling with CSS custom properties fallback for Safari. Document all browser-specific issues found.

## 2. GSAP Animation Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize all GSAP animations for smooth 60fps performance on mobile devices
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to identify animation bottlenecks. Implement will-change CSS property for animated elements. Convert complex animations to use transform and opacity only. Add GPU acceleration with transform3d. Implement reduced motion media query support. Use GSAP's built-in performance features like force3D and lazy rendering.

## 3. Touch Interaction and Gesture Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement and test all touch interactions, preventing gesture conflicts and ensuring smooth user experience
### Details:
Add touch-action CSS properties to prevent unwanted browser gestures. Implement passive event listeners for scroll performance. Test and fix any conflicts between swipe gestures and scroll. Ensure tap targets meet 44x44px minimum size. Add appropriate hover state fallbacks for touch devices. Implement fastclick behavior or use touch-action: manipulation.

## 4. JavaScript Bundle Optimization and Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Minimize JavaScript execution time through bundle optimization and strategic code splitting
### Details:
Implement dynamic imports for non-critical features. Use tree shaking to remove unused code. Minimize main thread blocking with web workers for heavy computations. Defer non-critical JavaScript loading. Implement intersection observer for lazy-loading components. Optimize Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS. Minify and compress all assets.

## 5. Image Loading Optimization and Final Performance Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Optimize all images for mobile performance and conduct final comprehensive performance validation
### Details:
Implement responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes. Convert images to WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks. Add lazy loading with native loading='lazy' attribute. Implement blur-up placeholder technique for hero images. Use intersection observer for below-fold images. Validate all Tailwind utilities are properly purged. Ensure critical CSS is inlined. Run final performance audits and create performance budget documentation.
