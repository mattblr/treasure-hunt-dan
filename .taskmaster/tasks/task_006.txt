# Task ID: 6
# Title: Add Countdown Timer with Tailwind Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement countdown timer showing time remaining until event with mobile-optimized display
# Details:
Create countdown timer using JavaScript Date API with Tailwind-styled components. Display days, hours, minutes, and seconds in separate styled containers using Tailwind's grid and spacing utilities. Add animated number transitions when values change. Include proper handling for countdown completion. Style with gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects consistent with overall design.

# Test Strategy:
Verify countdown accuracy, test number transitions are smooth, validate display on different screen sizes, confirm proper behavior when countdown reaches zero

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Countdown Timer Data Model and Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core JavaScript logic for calculating time differences between current time and target event date
### Details:
Create a JavaScript module that accepts a target date/time, calculates the difference from current time, and returns an object with days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Include methods for starting/stopping the timer, updating calculations every second using setInterval, and handling edge cases like negative time differences. Export functions for initialization, updating, and cleanup.

## 2. Build Tailwind-Styled Timer Display Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the HTML structure and Tailwind CSS classes for displaying the countdown timer with individual containers for each time unit
### Details:
Design a responsive grid layout using Tailwind's grid utilities (grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4) for days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit should have its own container with consistent padding, rounded corners (rounded-lg), and shadow effects. Include labels below each number. Structure should support mobile-first design with proper spacing using gap utilities.

## 3. Implement Glassmorphism and Gradient Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Apply glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds to timer components using Tailwind utilities and custom CSS
### Details:
Add backdrop-blur effects for glassmorphism using Tailwind's backdrop-blur-sm/md classes. Create gradient backgrounds using bg-gradient-to-br with color combinations that match the overall design theme. Apply semi-transparent backgrounds (bg-white/10 or bg-black/10) for the glass effect. Add subtle borders (border border-white/20) to enhance the glass appearance. Ensure proper contrast for readability.

## 4. Add Number Change Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement smooth transitions and animations when countdown numbers change using CSS transitions and JavaScript
### Details:
Use Tailwind's transition utilities (transition-all duration-300) for smooth number changes. Implement a flip animation or fade effect when digits update by toggling classes with JavaScript. Consider using transform utilities for scale or rotate effects during transitions. Add will-change-transform for performance optimization. Ensure animations don't cause layout shifts.

## 5. Handle Countdown Completion and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.4
### Description: Implement behavior for when the countdown reaches zero and handle various edge cases gracefully
### Details:
Create a completion state that displays a message or triggers an event when countdown reaches 00:00:00:00. Clear the interval timer to prevent negative values. Add error handling for invalid dates or network time sync issues. Include options for what happens after completion (hide timer, show message, trigger callback). Ensure the timer can be reinitialized with a new target date if needed.
