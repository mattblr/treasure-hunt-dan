# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Haptic Feedback and Mobile Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add vibration API haptic feedback on interactions and mobile-specific optimizations
# Details:
Implement Vibration API for haptic feedback on card swipes, button taps, and other interactions. Add feature detection for vibration support. Optimize touch targets for mobile (minimum 44px), implement proper touch event handling, add touch-action CSS properties. Include pull-to-refresh gesture for resetting experience using touch events and visual feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Test haptic feedback on devices that support it, verify touch targets are appropriately sized, validate pull-to-refresh functionality, ensure no conflicts with browser default gestures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Vibration API with Feature Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement core vibration functionality with proper browser feature detection and fallback handling
### Details:
Create a vibration utility module that checks for navigator.vibrate support. Implement different vibration patterns for various interactions (short tap: 10ms, swipe: 20ms, success: [50, 30, 50]). Add a settings toggle to enable/disable haptic feedback. Store user preference in localStorage.

## 2. Integrate Haptic Feedback for Card Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add vibration triggers to all card swipe gestures and related animations
### Details:
Trigger haptic feedback on: card swipe start (light vibration), card swipe threshold reached (medium vibration), card placement success/failure (distinct patterns). Implement debouncing to prevent excessive vibrations during rapid interactions. Add visual indicators when haptic feedback is triggered for accessibility.

## 3. Optimize Touch Targets and Interaction Areas [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements meet mobile accessibility guidelines with proper sizing and spacing
### Details:
Audit all buttons, cards, and interactive elements to ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets. Add appropriate padding without changing visual appearance using pseudo-elements or transparent borders. Implement proper touch-action CSS properties (manipulation for scrollable areas, none for gesture areas). Add -webkit-tap-highlight-color for better visual feedback.

## 4. Implement Touch Event Handling and Gestures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Add comprehensive touch event support for mobile-specific interactions and gestures
### Details:
Replace or supplement mouse events with touch equivalents (touchstart, touchmove, touchend). Implement proper touch event handling with preventDefault() where needed. Add support for multi-touch gestures if applicable. Handle touch event cancellation gracefully. Implement velocity-based swipe detection for more natural card interactions.

## 5. Add Pull-to-Refresh Gesture for Experience Reset [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.4
### Description: Implement a mobile-friendly pull-to-refresh mechanism to reset the entire experience
### Details:
Create pull-to-refresh functionality with: threshold detection (e.g., 80px pull distance), visual feedback indicator (spinning icon or progress bar), elastic animation during pull, haptic feedback at threshold and on release. Prevent accidental triggers with dead zone at top. Show confirmation before resetting. Animate cards back to deck position on refresh.
