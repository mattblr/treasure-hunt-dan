# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Special Animations and Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement confetti animation for final task, stagger animations on load, and easter egg features
# Details:
Create confetti animation using GSAP when viewing final task card with particle system or canvas-based animation. Implement stagger animations for UI elements on page load using GSAP timeline. Add easter egg animation when all cards are viewed using localStorage to track progress. Include celebration effects with sound (optional) and visual feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Test confetti animation performance on mobile devices, verify stagger animations don't cause lag, validate easter egg triggers correctly, confirm localStorage tracking works properly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up GSAP library and create confetti particle system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install GSAP library and create a reusable confetti animation component with customizable particle physics
### Details:
Install GSAP via npm/yarn. Create a ConfettiAnimation class that generates multiple particle elements with random colors, sizes, and trajectories. Use GSAP's physics2D plugin for realistic falling motion with gravity and wind effects. Implement particle pooling for performance optimization.

## 2. Implement stagger animations for UI elements on page load [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create GSAP timeline animations that stagger the appearance of UI elements when the page loads
### Details:
Build a StaggerAnimations utility that uses GSAP timelines to animate opacity, scale, and position of cards and UI elements. Implement progressive reveal with customizable delays and easing functions. Add intersection observer for viewport-based triggering of animations.

## 3. Create progress tracking system with localStorage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a system to track which task cards have been viewed and store progress in localStorage
### Details:
Create a ProgressTracker class that maintains a Set of viewed card IDs in localStorage. Implement methods to mark cards as viewed, check completion status, and clear progress. Add event listeners to detect when cards are clicked or expanded. Include data persistence and recovery logic.

## 4. Build easter egg animation trigger and effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create the easter egg animation that triggers when all cards have been viewed
### Details:
Implement an EasterEggManager that monitors progress and triggers celebration effects when all cards are viewed. Create a combination animation using GSAP that includes screen flash, rotating elements, and cascading effects. Add subtle UI changes like special borders or badges for completed sections.

## 5. Add celebration sound effects and accessibility features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement optional sound effects for animations and ensure all effects are accessible
### Details:
Create an AudioManager class for playing celebration sounds with volume controls and mute options. Add prefers-reduced-motion media query support to disable or simplify animations. Implement ARIA live regions to announce completion events to screen readers. Add settings toggle for users to enable/disable effects.
